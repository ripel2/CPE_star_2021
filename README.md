# CPE_star_2021
Epitech first project

## About this project

This project is the first project that we made at Epitech, a few days after the C Pool started.

## How to use

First compile with the Makefile

```sh
make
```

Then launch the program by typing
```sh
./star
```

When we did the project, we only had to create the function `star`. We also didn't have
to use a Makefile to compile the star into a executable. Thus, the star printed on screen
is hardcoded to be of size 5.
